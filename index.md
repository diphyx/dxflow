## About dxflow

### Our Journey

dxflow began as an internal initiative at [DiPhyX](https://www.diphyx.com) to streamline sprawling scripts, clusters, and ad-hoc logs that slow down scientific progress. Initially a weekend hack intended to create a "MLFlow for physics and chemistry," it has evolved through numerous projects in bioinformatics, CFD, and materials science into a robust, production-grade engine available for everyone.

### Our Mission

We are committed to accelerating scientific innovation by offering a unified, scalable, and intuitive cloud platform for end-to-end computational pipelines. Every feature in dxflow is designed to help researchers:
1. Speed up discovery.
2. Ensure reproducibility.
3. Simplify complex computational workflows.

### Scientific-First Approach

**Built for Real Research Needs:**
- **Native Compatibility**: Works with GROMACS, Ansys Fluent, custom solvers, and any containerized application
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Runs on existing infrastructure without requiring cloud migration
- **Researcher-Friendly**: Designed by scientists who understand the pain of failed overnight runs
