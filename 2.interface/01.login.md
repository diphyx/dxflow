The first step to use the Interface is to login. The login requires a `private key` that is used to authenticate your identity. This key is generated when you first set up the dxflow engine and is stored on your local machine.

## Authentication Process

To access the dxflow web interface, you need to authenticate using your private key. Here's how the login process works:

### 1. Access the Login Page

Navigate to your dxflow engine's web interface in your browser:
- Local installation: `http://localhost` (or your configured port)
- Remote server: `http://<your-server-ip>:<port>`

### 2. Locate Your Private Key

Your private key is automatically generated when you first set up dxflow and is stored in:
```
~/.dxflow/keys/
```

You can list your available keys using:
```bash
dxflow engine key list
```

### 3. Authentication Process

The authentication uses a challenge-response mechanism via the following API endpoints:

#### **Challenge Generation**
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/auth/challenge/`
- Generates a unique challenge with identity, nonce, and lifetime
- Returns challenge data required for signature generation

#### **Signature Verification** 
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/verify/`
- Verifies your private key signature against the challenge
- Returns JWT authentication token upon successful verification
- Configurable token lifetime (1 minute to 1 hour)

#### **Authentication Inspection**
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/auth/inspect/`
- Validates current authentication state
- Requires valid JWT token in request headers

### 4. Session Management

Once authenticated:
- Your session will remain active until you logout or the session expires
- The interface will remember your authentication state across browser tabs
- You can logout anytime using the logout button in the interface

### Security Notes

- Private keys are sensitive credentials - never share them with others
- Keys are processed locally and securely transmitted to your dxflow engine
- If you suspect your key is compromised, generate a new one immediately:

```bash
dxflow engine key generate
```
