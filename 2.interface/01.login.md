## Getting Started

::steps
  ### Step 1: Locate Your Private Key
  
  Your private key is automatically generated when you first set up dxflow:
  
  ```bash
  # List available keys
  dxflow engine key list
  ```
  
  Keys are stored in: `~/.dxflow/keys/`
  
  ### Step 2: Access the Login Page
  
  Navigate to your dxflow engine's web interface:
  - **Local installation**: `http://localhost` (or your configured port)
  - **Remote server**: `http://<your-server-ip>:<port>`
  
  ### Step 3: Authenticate
  
  The web interface will guide you through the authentication process using your private key.

## Authentication Process

### Challenge-Response Mechanism

The authentication system uses a secure challenge-response protocol:

::tabs
  ::tab-item{label="Challenge Generation" icon="i-hugeicons:shield-energy"}
  
  **Step 1: Request Challenge**
  - **Endpoint**: `GET /api/auth/challenge/`
  - **Purpose**: Generate unique authentication challenge
  - **Returns**: Challenge data with identity, nonce, and lifetime
  
  ```json
  {
    "identity": "your-key-identity",
    "nonce": "random-challenge-string",
    "lifetime": 300
  }
  ```
  
  ::

  ::tab-item{label="Signature Verification" icon="i-hugeicons:checkmark-badge-01"}
  
  **Step 2: Sign and Verify**
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/verify/`
  - **Purpose**: Verify signature against challenge
  - **Process**: Your private key signs the challenge data
  - **Returns**: JWT authentication token on success
  
  ```json
  {
    "token": "jwt-authentication-token",
    "expires": 1640995200
  }
  ```
  
  ::

  ::tab-item{label="Session Validation" icon="i-hugeicons:time-management"}
  
  **Step 3: Session Management**
  - **Endpoint**: `GET /api/auth/inspect/`
  - **Purpose**: Validate current authentication state
  - **Headers**: Requires valid JWT token
  - **Returns**: Current session information and permissions
  
  ```json
  {
    "authenticated": true,
    "identity": "your-key-identity",
    "permissions": ["SHELL", "OBJECT", "WORKFLOW"],
    "expires": 1640995200
  }
  ```

## Key Management

### Automatic Key Generation

When you first install dxflow, keys are automatically generated:

::callout
**First Time Setup**: dxflow automatically creates your first RSA key pair during initial engine startup. No manual configuration required!
::

### Manual Key Operations

For advanced key management:

::card{title="Key Management Commands" icon="i-hugeicons:folder-security"}
```bash
# List all keys
dxflow engine key list

# Generate new key pair
dxflow engine key generate

# Register additional keys
dxflow engine key register <public-key-file>

# Remove keys
dxflow engine key unregister <key-identity>
```
::

### Key Security Best Practices

::tabs
  ::tab-item{label="Protection"}
  
  **Safeguard Your Keys**
  - Store private keys securely with appropriate file permissions
  - Never share private keys with others
  - Use different keys for different environments (dev/prod)
  - Regular key rotation for high-security environments
  
  ::

  ::tab-item{label="Backup"}
  
  **Key Backup Strategy**
  - Backup key files to secure location
  - Document key identities and their purposes
  - Test key restore procedures
  - Maintain key recovery procedures
  
  ::

  ::tab-item{label="Monitoring"}
  
  **Security Monitoring**
  - Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity
  - Track key usage patterns
  - Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
  - Regular security audits of key access

## Session Management

### Session Configuration

Configure session behavior to match your security requirements:

::card-group
  ::card{title="Session Duration" icon="i-hugeicons:clock-01"}
  **Flexible Timing**
  - Minimum: 1 minute (high-security environments)
  - Maximum: 1 hour (convenience vs. security balance)
  - Default: 30 minutes (recommended for most use cases)
  ::

  ::card{title="Session Persistence" icon="i-hugeicons:database-01"}
  **Cross-Browser Support**
  - Persistent across browser tabs
  - Survives page refresh and navigation
  - Automatic cleanup on expiration
  - Manual logout capability
  ::
::

### Session Features

- **Automatic Renewal**: Sessions renew automatically during active use
- **Secure Logout**: Complete token invalidation on logout
- **Cross-Tab Sync**: Authentication state shared across browser tabs
- **Connection Recovery**: Graceful handling of network interruptions

## Troubleshooting

::tabs
  ::tab-item{label="Authentication Issues"}
  
  **Cannot locate private key:**
  - Check if keys exist: `dxflow engine key list`
  - Verify key file permissions are correct
  - Ensure `.dxflow/keys/` directory exists
  
  **Authentication fails repeatedly:**
  - Verify system clock is accurate (affects token timing)
  - Check if key has been corrupted or modified
  - Try generating a new key: `dxflow engine key generate`
  
  **Browser shows "Unauthorized" errors:**
  - Clear browser cache and cookies
  - Disable browser extensions that might interfere
  - Try authentication in incognito/private browsing mode
  
  ::

  ::tab-item{label="Session Problems"}
  
  **Session expires too quickly:**
  - Check engine configuration for session timeout settings
  - Verify system time synchronization
  - Consider increasing session duration for your use case
  
  **Cannot maintain session across tabs:**
  - Ensure cookies are enabled in browser
  - Check if browser storage is available
  - Verify no browser security policies blocking session storage
  
  **Frequent logouts:**
  - Check network stability and connection quality
  - Verify engine is running continuously
  - Review authentication logs for timeout patterns
  
  ::

  ::tab-item{label="Key Management"}
  
  **Lost or corrupted keys:**
  - Generate new key pair: `dxflow engine key generate`
  - Update any automation scripts with new key identity
  - Document new key information securely
  
  **Permission denied errors:**
  - Verify key has proper permissions for required operations
  - Check user role assignments in engine configuration
  - Ensure key is properly registered: `dxflow engine key list`
  
  **Multiple key conflicts:**
  - List all keys to identify duplicates or conflicts
  - Remove unused keys: `dxflow engine key unregister <identity>`
  - Ensure unique key names and identities

## Security Considerations

### Network Security
- **HTTPS Recommended**: Use HTTPS in production environments
- **Firewall Configuration**: Restrict access to authorized IP addresses
- **VPN Access**: Consider VPN access for remote administration
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor authentication traffic for anomalies

### Operational Security
- **Regular Audits**: Review authentication logs regularly
- **Access Reviews**: Periodically review user access and permissions
- **Incident Response**: Have procedures for compromised key scenarios
- **Backup Authentication**: Maintain alternative access methods for emergencies

::callout{color="amber"}
**Security Warning**: If you suspect your private key has been compromised, immediately generate a new key and revoke the old one. Monitor authentication logs for unauthorized access attempts.
