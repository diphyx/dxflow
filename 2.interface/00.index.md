# User Interface

The dxflow user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily navigate through the various features and functionalities of the dxflow engine. It is accessible via a web browser and provides a comprehensive overview of the workflows, tasks, and resources managed by dxflow.

## Prerequisites

To access the user interface, you need to have the dxflow engine installed and running. You can check if it is installed by running the following command:

```bash
dxflow engine up
```

This command prints the status of the dxflow engine. If it is running, you will see a message indicating that the engine is up and running:

```bash
Engine successfully booted (use 'CTRL+C' to stop) [~/.dxflow/unix.sock] [0.0.0.0:80]
```

## Accessing the Interface

If you don't assign any port to the engine, it will run on port 80 by default. You can access the UI by opening your web browser and navigating to:

- **Local access**: `http://localhost`
- **Remote access**: `http://<your-server-ip>`
