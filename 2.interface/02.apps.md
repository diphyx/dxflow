The Apps & Pipelines section of the dxflow interface provides a comprehensive platform for managing containerized applications and complex workflows. This interface allows you to deploy, monitor, and manage Docker-based applications with ease.

## Overview

The Apps interface integrates with Docker Compose to provide:
- **Application Deployment**: Deploy multi-container applications using Docker Compose files
- **Pipeline Management**: Create and manage complex workflows and data processing pipelines
- **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor container health, logs, and performance metrics
- **Lifecycle Management**: Start, stop, pause, and remove applications as needed

## Key Features

### 1. Application Dashboard

The main dashboard provides:
- **Active Applications**: View all running applications and their status
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU, memory, and storage consumption
- **Quick Actions**: Start, stop, restart applications with one click
- **Health Status**: Real-time health checks and status indicators

### 2. Compose File Management

#### **Upload Compose Files**
- Drag and drop Docker Compose files directly into the interface
- Built-in validation to check compose file syntax
- Support for multiple compose file formats and versions

#### **Template Library**
- Pre-configured templates for common applications
- Custom template creation and sharing
- Version control for compose file changes

### 3. Application Deployment

#### **Deploy New Applications**
1. **Upload or Create**: Upload existing compose files or create new ones using the built-in editor
2. **Configure**: Set environment variables, port mappings, and volume mounts
3. **Deploy**: Launch applications with a single click
4. **Monitor**: Track deployment progress and view logs in real-time

#### **Environment Management**
- **Environment Variables**: Set and manage environment variables per application
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of sensitive configuration data
- **Config Files**: Mount configuration files and manage application settings

### 4. Pipeline Orchestration

#### **Workflow Creation**
- **Visual Editor**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating complex pipelines
- **Step Configuration**: Define individual pipeline steps and their dependencies
- **Conditional Logic**: Implement branching and conditional execution paths

#### **Pipeline Templates**
- **Data Processing**: Templates for ETL, data transformation, and analysis workflows
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Continuous integration and deployment pipeline templates
- **Custom Workflows**: Create and save custom pipeline templates

### 5. Monitoring & Logging

#### **Real-time Monitoring**
- **Container Metrics**: CPU, memory, network, and disk usage statistics
- **Application Logs**: Centralized log viewing with search and filtering
- **Performance Alerts**: Configurable alerts for resource thresholds

#### **Log Management**
- **Aggregated Logs**: View logs from all containers in one interface
- **Log Filtering**: Filter logs by container, time range, or log level
- **Export Options**: Download logs for external analysis

### 6. Application Management

#### **Lifecycle Operations**
```bash
# Available operations through the interface:
- Start/Stop applications
- Pause/Unpause containers
- Restart applications
- Scale services up or down
- Remove applications and cleanup resources
```

#### **Batch Operations**
- **Bulk Actions**: Perform operations on multiple applications simultaneously
- **Scheduled Operations**: Schedule start/stop operations for optimal resource usage
- **Dependency Management**: Handle application dependencies automatically

## API Reference

### **Workflow Management Endpoints**

The Apps & Pipelines system provides comprehensive REST API endpoints:

```bash
# Core workflow operations
GET    /api/workflow/compose/              # List all compose workflows
POST   /api/workflow/compose/              # Create new compose workflow
DELETE /api/workflow/compose/              # Remove single workflow
DELETE /api/workflow/compose/batch/        # Remove multiple workflows

# Workflow lifecycle management
PUT    /api/workflow/compose/start/        # Start workflow
PUT    /api/workflow/compose/stop/         # Stop workflow
PUT    /api/workflow/compose/restart/      # Restart workflow
PUT    /api/workflow/compose/pause/        # Pause workflow containers
PUT    /api/workflow/compose/unpause/      # Unpause workflow containers

# Monitoring and management
GET    /api/workflow/compose/containers/   # Get container information
GET    /api/workflow/compose/events/       # Stream workflow events
GET    /api/workflow/compose/logs/         # Get workflow logs
PUT    /api/workflow/compose/execute/      # Execute commands in containers
PUT    /api/workflow/compose/kill/         # Kill workflow processes
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Access the Apps Section

After logging in, navigate to the "Apps & Pipelines" section from the main menu.

### 2. Deploy Your First Application

1. **Click "New Application"**
2. **Choose a method**:
   - Upload existing Docker Compose file
   - Use a template from the library
   - Create new compose file using the editor
3. **Configure settings** (ports, volumes, environment variables)
4. **Click "Deploy"** to launch your application

### 3. Monitor Your Applications

- View application status on the main dashboard
- Click on any application to see detailed metrics and logs
- Use the monitoring tools to track performance and resource usage

## Best Practices

### **Resource Management**
- Set appropriate resource limits for containers
- Monitor resource usage regularly
- Use health checks to ensure application reliability

### **Security**
- Use secrets management for sensitive data
- Configure proper network isolation
- Regular security updates for base images

### **Backup & Recovery**
- Regular backups of application data
- Document deployment configurations
- Test recovery procedures periodically

The Apps & Pipelines interface makes container orchestration accessible and manageable, whether you're running simple applications or complex multi-service architectures.
