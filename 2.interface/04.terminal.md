The Terminal Access section of the dxflow interface provides a powerful web-based terminal that connects you directly to containerized environments. This feature enables command-line interaction with your workflows, applications, and the underlying system infrastructure.

## Overview

The Terminal interface offers comprehensive command-line access:

- **Web-based Terminal**: Full-featured terminal accessible through your browser
- **Container Shell Access**: Connect to running containers and applications
- **Multi-session Support**: Multiple concurrent terminal sessions
- **Secure Connection**: Encrypted connections with proper authentication
- **Session Management**: Persistent sessions with reconnection capabilities

## Key Features

### 1. Web Terminal Interface

The web-based terminal provides a native command-line experience:

#### **Terminal Emulation**

- **Full VT100/xterm Compatibility**: Support for all standard terminal features
- **Unicode Support**: Full UTF-8 character set support
- **Resize Handling**: Automatic terminal resizing based on browser window
- **Copy/Paste**: Standard keyboard shortcuts and context menu support
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time bidirectional terminal communication

### 2. Shell Management

#### **Shell Session Management**

**Shell Session Creation via Web Interface**

Through the web interface, you can:

- **Create New Shell**: Click "New Terminal" to spawn a new shell session
- **Choose Shell Type**: Select bash, zsh, sh, or custom shell paths
- **Set Working Directory**: Start the shell in a specific directory
- **Configure Environment**: Set environment variables for the session

**Shell Session Management**

Each shell session has:

- **Unique Identity**: Auto-generated or custom session identifier
- **WebSocket Connection**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Session State**: Tracks running processes and command history
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU and memory usage tracking

**Advanced Shell Configuration**

- **Environment Variables**: Set custom environment variables per shell
- **Working Directory**: Start shells in specific directories
- **User Context**: Run shells as different users (with proper permissions)
- **Resource Limits**: Configure CPU and memory limits for shell processes

### 3. Terminal Operations

#### **Interactive Shell Usage**

**Command Execution**

- **Real-time Commands**: Execute any shell command directly in the web terminal
- **Process Management**: Run background processes, use job control (Ctrl+Z, fg, bg)
- **File Operations**: Create, edit, move, and delete files using standard Unix commands
- **Directory Navigation**: Navigate the filesystem using cd, ls, pwd, and other commands

**Terminal Features**

- **Command History**: Access previous commands using arrow keys or history command
- **Tab Completion**: Auto-complete filenames and commands
- **Signal Handling**: Send signals to processes (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+D)
- **Screen Management**: Clear screen, scroll through output, resize terminal

### 4. Container Shell Access

#### **Containerized Environment Access**

**Direct Container Connection**

- **Running Containers**: Access shell sessions inside active application containers
- **Service Containers**: Connect to database, cache, and other service containers
- **Development Environments**: Access development tools and environments within containers

**Container Terminal Features**

- **Container Filesystem**: Full access to container's file system and directories
- **Container Processes**: View and manage processes running inside containers
- **Environment Isolation**: Each container provides isolated shell environment
- **Network Access**: Access container's network interfaces and services

### 5. Session Management

#### **Multi-Session Support**

**Session Control**

- **Multiple Terminals**: Open and manage multiple terminal sessions simultaneously
- **Session Persistence**: Sessions remain active even when browser tab is closed
- **Auto-reconnection**: Automatic reconnection to existing sessions on page reload
- **Session Sharing**: Share terminal sessions with team members for collaboration

**Session Monitoring**

- **Active Sessions**: View list of all active terminal sessions
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU and memory usage per session
- **Connection Status**: Real-time connection status and health monitoring
- **Session History**: Track command history and session activity

### 6. API Integration

#### **WebSocket Connection**

The terminal uses WebSocket connections for real-time communication:

**Connection Endpoints**

```bash
GET /api/shell/:identity/    # WebSocket connection to specific shell session
```

**Session Management API**

```bash
GET    /api/shell/           # List all active shell sessions
POST   /api/shell/           # Create new shell session
PUT    /api/shell/resize/    # Resize terminal dimensions
PUT    /api/shell/execute/   # Execute commands programmatically
PUT    /api/shell/kill/      # Kill processes in shell
DELETE /api/shell/           # Remove shell session
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Access Terminal

After logging in, navigate to the "Terminal Access" section from the main menu.

### 2. Create Your First Shell

1. **Click "New Terminal"** to create a new shell session
2. **Choose environment**:
    - System shell (direct access to host system)
    - Container shell (access to running container)
    - Custom environment (specific working directory or user)
3. **Configure session** (optional):
    - Set working directory
    - Configure environment variables
    - Choose shell type (bash, zsh, sh)

### 3. Basic Terminal Usage

Once connected to a shell session:

**Essential Commands**

- `pwd` - Show current directory
- `ls -la` - List files and directories
- `cd /path` - Change directory
- `cat filename` - View file contents
- `nano filename` - Edit files
- `ps aux` - View running processes
- `top` - Real-time process monitor

**File Management**

- Create files: `touch filename` or `echo "content" > filename`
- Create directories: `mkdir directory_name`
- Copy files: `cp source destination`
- Move files: `mv source destination`
- Delete files: `rm filename`

## Best Practices

### **Security**

- Use appropriate user permissions for different tasks
- Avoid running unnecessary services as root user
- Regular cleanup of temporary files and processes
- Monitor resource usage to prevent system overload

### **Session Management**

- Use descriptive names for long-running sessions
- Clean up unused sessions to free resources
- Use screen or tmux for persistent background processes
- Document important session configurations and setups

### **Performance**

- Limit the number of concurrent sessions
- Monitor system resources during intensive operations
- Use efficient commands and avoid resource-heavy processes
- Close unused terminal sessions promptly

### **Workflow Integration**

- Use terminal for debugging application issues
- Access container environments for troubleshooting
- Combine terminal access with file management for efficient workflows
- Leverage shell scripting for automation tasks

The Terminal Access interface provides direct shell access to your dxflow environment, enabling powerful command-line operations, debugging capabilities, and system administration tasks through an intuitive web-based terminal.
