## Installation

### Command not found

```bash
# Add to PATH
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

# Or reinstall
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diphyx/dxflow/main/assets/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### Permission denied

```bash
# Linux/macOS
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dxflow
```

::callout{color="blue"}
Alternatively on macOS: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway
::

## Boot Issues

### Port already in use

```bash
# Find process using the port
sudo lsof -i :80

# Kill the process
sudo kill -9 <PID>

# Or change dxflow port
dxflow config set http-port 8080
```

### Daemon won't start

::callout{color="amber"}
Linux-only feature. See [Persistent Daemon FAQ](/docs/faqs/persistent-daemon)
::

### Cannot use --proxy and --bridge together

::callout{color="amber"}
These modes are mutually exclusive. See [Tunneling docs](/docs/advanced/tunneling)
::

## Network

### Bridge won't connect to hub

```bash
# Test bridge connection
dxflow bridge list
```

**Checklist:**
- Verify hub has `--proxy` enabled
- Check firewall allows port 80/443

### Subdomain not accessible

```bash
# Test bridge connection
dxflow bridge list
```

**Checklist:**
- Check DNS wildcard: `*.domain.com → hub-ip`
- Verify proxy is running

## Authentication

### 401 Unauthorized - JWT token expired

```bash
# Regenerate token manually
dxflow engine token

# Or auto-regenerate
dxflow ping
```

### RSA key authentication fails

```bash
# Verify RSA format
openssl rsa -in key.pem -check

# Generate new key
dxflow key generate mykey

# Register public key
dxflow key register mykey.pub
```

## Performance

### Slow API responses

```bash
# Check health status
dxflow healthcheck

# View resource statistics
dxflow stat
```

**Tips:**
- Enable streaming with `?stream=true` for large data operations

### High memory usage

```bash
# Monitor resource usage
dxflow stat
```

**Tips:**
- Use streaming for large operations
- Limit concurrent workflows

### Bridge tunnel has high latency

::callout{color="amber"}
This is expected behavior. Use proxy mode for production environments.
::

## Workflows

### Docker containers won't start

```bash
# Verify Docker is running
docker ps

# Check container logs
dxflow compose logs <name>

# Validate compose file
docker-compose -f file.yml config
```

### Web interface not loading

```bash
# Check engine status
dxflow ping

# Test API directly
curl http://localhost/api/engine/ping
```

::callout{color="blue"}
If API works but UI doesn't load, clear browser cache with `Ctrl+Shift+R`
::

## File Operations

### Upload/Download fails

```bash
# Check available disk space
df -h

# Test with smaller file first
dxflow fs upload small-file.txt /path/
```

**Checklist:**
- Verify permissions on destination directory
- Ensure sufficient disk space

### ZIP operations fail

```bash
# Verify source exists
dxflow fs list /path
```

::callout{color="blue"}
ZIP operations require 2x file size for temporary space
::

## Quick Reference

### Debug Commands
```bash
dxflow engine info       # System details
dxflow stat             # Resource usage
dxflow healthcheck      # Health status
dxflow --log-level=debug boot up  # Debug mode
```

### Log Locations (Daemon)
| Init System | Log Files |
|-------------|-----------|
| **SystemD** | `/tmp/dxflow.out` and `/tmp/dxflow.err` |
| **OpenRC** | `/var/log/dxflow-engine.out` and `.err` |

### Common Error Codes
| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `bind: address already in use` | Port conflict | Change port or kill process |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Token expired | Run `dxflow ping` |
| `connection refused` | Engine not running | Run `dxflow boot up` |
| `permission denied` | File permissions | Check ownership/permissions |
