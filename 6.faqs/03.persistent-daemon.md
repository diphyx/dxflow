## Default Behavior

By default on Linux systems, the dxflow daemon operates as a user service tied to your active login session. When you log out, the service automatically stops, preventing it from running persistently in the background.

## Platform Support

The `--daemon` flag is supported on:

| Platform | Init System | Support |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Linux** | SystemD | ✅ Full support |
| **Linux** | OpenRC | ✅ Full support |
| **macOS** | - | ❌ Not supported |
| **Windows** | - | ❌ Not supported |

## Starting the Daemon

```bash
# Start as background daemon
dxflow boot up --daemon

# Start with additional options
dxflow boot up --daemon --https --proxy
```

## Enabling Persistence

To ensure the dxflow daemon service persists across user sessions and continues running after log out on Linux, enable user lingering:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

This command allows your user services to start at boot time and remain active even when you're not logged in, effectively making them behave like system services while maintaining user-level permissions.

## Managing the Daemon

### Stop the daemon
```bash
dxflow boot down
```

### Check daemon status
```bash
# SystemD (most Linux distributions)
systemctl status dxflow-engine

# OpenRC (Alpine, Gentoo)
rc-service dxflow-engine status
```

### View daemon logs
```bash
# SystemD (stored in /tmp)
tail -f /tmp/dxflow.out
tail -f /tmp/dxflow.err

# OpenRC (stored in /var/log)
tail -f /var/log/dxflow-engine.out
tail -f /var/log/dxflow-engine.err
```

**Note**: macOS and Windows do not support daemon mode. On these platforms, use foreground mode or consider using screen/tmux for background operation.
