## Default Behavior

By default on Linux systems, the dxflow daemon operates as a user service tied to your active login session. When you log out, the service automatically stops, preventing it from running persistently in the background.

## Enabling Persistence

To ensure the dxflow daemon service persists across user sessions and continues running after log out on Linux, enable user lingering:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

This command allows your user services to start at boot time and remain active even when you're not logged in, effectively making them behave like system services while maintaining user-level permissions.
