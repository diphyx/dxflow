To generate a dxflow key, you can use the `ssh-keygen` command. This command will create a new RSA key pair that you can use to authenticate with the dxflow engine.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "<your_email@example.com>"
```
This command will prompt you to enter a file name to save the key. You can press Enter to accept the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) or specify a different path.
After running the command, you will have two files:
- `id_rsa`: This is your private key. Keep it secure and do not share it with anyone.
- `id_rsa.pub`: This is your public key. You can share this key with others or use it to authenticate with the dxflow engine.
