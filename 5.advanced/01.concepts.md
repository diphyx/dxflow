Understanding these core concepts and architecture patterns will help you leverage dxflow's full potential for distributed computing and workflow orchestration.

## Architecture Overview

dxflow is designed as a powerful and flexible workflow engine built with a modular architecture that enables seamless orchestration of data and compute workflows across heterogeneous computing environments.

::callout{color="blue"}
**Architecture Philosophy**: dxflow follows a "compute-first" design where the engine runs close to your workloads, eliminating data movement bottlenecks and reducing operational complexity. The modular design enables clean separation between CLI tools, business logic, and platform-specific implementations.
::

### Layered Architecture

dxflow follows a layered, modular architecture designed for flexibility and scalability:

::card-group
  ::card{title="Infrastructure Layer" icon="i-hugeicons:cloud-server"}
  Physical or virtual machines, cloud instances, edge devices
  ::

  ::card{title="Engine Layer" icon="i-hugeicons:cpu-charge"}
  The dxflow daemon providing core services and APIs
  ::

  ::card{title="Runtime Layer" icon="i-hugeicons:codesandbox"}
  Docker, Kubernetes, Slurm, or other orchestration platforms
  ::

  ::card{title="Application Layer" icon="i-hugeicons:database"}
  Your actual workloads, models, and data processing pipelines
  ::
::

This layered approach allows dxflow to integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure while providing a consistent interface across diverse environments.

## Deployment Patterns

dxflow supports two primary deployment patterns, each optimized for different use cases and organizational needs:

::card-group
  ::card{title="Node-Embedded"}
  **Direct Integration**

  Every compute node runs its own dxflow engine with no additional control layer between infrastructure and schedulers.

  **Best For:**
  - High-performance computing clusters
  - Edge computing deployments
  - Minimal operational overhead scenarios
  - Maximum performance requirements
  ::

  ::card{title="Federated Master"}
  **Centralized Orchestration**

  A master dxflow instance coordinates a fleet of engine agents across multiple nodes and environments.

  **Best For:**
  - Multi-cloud deployments
  - Complex workflow orchestration
  - Centralized monitoring and control
  - Enterprise governance requirements
  ::
::

::callout{color="green"}
**Performance**: The most common and recommended deployment pattern is **Node-Embedded**, offering the lowest latency and highest throughput by eliminating network hops between the engine and compute resources.
::

### Node-Embedded Deployment

![dxflow Architecture](/assets/architecture_light.png)
The Node-Embedded pattern places a dxflow engine directly on every compute target—whether it's an EC2 spot instance, an on-premises Slurm node, or a Docker container on a lab workstation.

#### Key Characteristics

::card-group
  ::card{title="Ultra-Fast Bootstrap" icon="i-hugeicons:dashboard-speed-01"}
  - **≤ 2 Second Startup**: Engine boots and registers instantly
  - **Automatic Registration**: RSA key-pair authentication setup
  - **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults
  ::

  ::card{title="Uniform Endpoints" icon="i-hugeicons:equal-sign-square"}
  - **Consistent APIs**: Same interface across all node types
  - **Standard Ports**: Predictable networking and discovery
  - **Auto-Discovery**: Engines announce themselves to the fleet
  ::
::

#### Integration with Schedulers

Because the runtime is embedded at the node level, dxflow cohabits peacefully with any resource scheduler already present:

- **Slurm / PBS / LSF**: The prolog script starts dxflow when a job allocation begins
- **Kubernetes / Nomad**: Deploy the agent as a DaemonSet or side-car
- **Docker Compose / Podman**: Include the dxflow container in the same docker-compose.yml
- **Spark / Ray / AWS Batch**: Each executor or EC2 instance bundles the agent via user-data

This design mirrors the side-car model popularised by Dapr: place a lightweight process next to every workload to provide cross-cutting capabilities.

### Federated Master Deployment

In the federated master deployment, a single dxflow instance acts as a control plane for the entire fleet of compute nodes. This master instance orchestrates the dxflow agents running on each node or container, providing a centralized interface for managing and monitoring computational tasks.

## Core Components
