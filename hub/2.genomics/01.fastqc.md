FastQC is a quality control tool for high throughput sequence data. It provides a modular set of analyses to give you a quick impression of whether your data has any problems before you do any further analysis.

## Overview

FastQC can be run in one of two modes: interactive or non-interactive. In non-interactive mode, the program will process all specified files and produce an HTML report for each one.

**Key Features:**
- Import data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files
- Quick overview of quality control metrics
- Summary graphs and tables
- Identify problems in sequencing data
- Export reports in HTML format

## Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  fastqc:
    image: biocontainers/fastqc:v0.11.9_cv8
    container_name: dxflow-fastqc

    # Working directory
    working_dir: /data

    # Mount volumes for input/output
    volumes:
      - ./input:/data/input:ro
      - ./output:/data/output

    # Command to run FastQC
    command: >
      fastqc
      /data/input/*.fastq.gz
      --outdir /data/output
      --threads 4

    # Resource limits
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '4'
          memory: 4G
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Prepare Data

Upload your FASTQ files:

```bash
# Create input directory
mkdir -p input output

# Upload your sequencing files
dxflow fs upload /local/sample_R1.fastq.gz input/
dxflow fs upload /local/sample_R2.fastq.gz input/
```

### Step 2: Deploy Workflow

```bash
# Deploy FastQC workflow
dxflow compose create --identity fastqc-analysis fastqc.yml

# Start analysis
dxflow compose start fastqc-analysis
```

### Step 3: Monitor Progress

```bash
# View logs
dxflow compose logs fastqc-analysis

# Check status
dxflow compose list
```

### Step 4: Retrieve Results

```bash
# Download HTML reports
dxflow fs download output/ /local/fastqc-results/
```

## Configuration Options

### Basic Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--threads` | Number of CPU threads | 1 |
| `--outdir` | Output directory | Current directory |
| `--extract` | Extract ZIP files | false |
| `--noextract` | Do not extract ZIP files | false |

### Advanced Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--casava` | Files from Casava pipeline |
| `--nofilter` | Do not filter sequences |
| `--format` | Input file format (fastq, bam, sam) |
| `--contaminants` | Custom contaminants file |
| `--adapters` | Custom adapters file |
| `--limits` | Custom limits file |

## Output Files

FastQC generates the following output files:

- **`*_fastqc.html`** - HTML report with all graphs and tables
- **`*_fastqc.zip`** - ZIP archive containing detailed data files
- **`summary.txt`** - Summary of pass/warn/fail for all modules
- **`fastqc_data.txt`** - Raw data for all analyses

## Quality Metrics

FastQC evaluates several quality metrics:

### Basic Statistics
- File name, type, encoding
- Total sequences, filtered sequences
- Sequence length, %GC content

### Per Base Sequence Quality
- Quality score distribution across all bases
- Identifies low quality regions
- **PASS**: Median quality ≥ 25
- **WARN**: Lower quartile < 10 or median < 25
- **FAIL**: Lower quartile < 5 or median < 20

### Per Sequence Quality Scores
- Distribution of quality scores across all sequences
- **PASS**: Most sequences have quality > 27
- **WARN**: Peak quality < 27
- **FAIL**: Peak quality < 20

### Sequence Duplication Levels
- Degree of duplication in the library
- High duplication may indicate PCR amplification issues

### Adapter Content
- Presence of adapter sequences
- Important for trimming decisions

## Example Workflow

Complete analysis workflow:

```bash
# 1. Upload raw FASTQ files
dxflow fs upload raw_data/ input/

# 2. Deploy and run FastQC
dxflow compose create --identity qc fastqc.yml
dxflow compose start qc

# 3. Wait for completion (monitor logs)
dxflow compose logs -f qc

# 4. Download reports
dxflow fs download output/ results/

# 5. Review HTML reports in browser
# 6. Decide on trimming/filtering based on results
```

## System Requirements

**Minimum:**
- CPU: 2 cores
- RAM: 2GB
- Storage: 10GB

**Recommended:**
- CPU: 4+ cores for faster processing
- RAM: 4GB for large files
- Storage: 50GB for multiple samples

## Performance Tips

**Optimize Processing:**
- Use multiple threads for faster analysis
- Process multiple files in parallel
- Use local SSD for better I/O performance

**Batch Processing:**
```yaml
# Process all FASTQ files in parallel
command: >
  parallel -j 4 fastqc {} --outdir /data/output ::: /data/input/*.fastq.gz
```

## Interpreting Results

### Good Quality Data
- Per base quality scores mostly in green zone (>28)
- Even GC content distribution
- Low duplication levels
- No adapter contamination

### Issues to Watch For
- **Declining quality** at 3' end → Consider trimming
- **Unusual GC content** → Possible contamination
- **High duplication** → Library complexity issues
- **Adapter content** → Trimming required
- **Overrepresented sequences** → Possible contamination

## Troubleshooting

**Container fails to start:**
- Check input file permissions
- Verify volume mount paths exist
- Ensure sufficient disk space

**Out of memory errors:**
- Increase memory limit in compose file
- Process files individually
- Use smaller file chunks

**No output files:**
- Check command syntax
- Verify output directory is writable
- Review container logs for errors

## Next Steps

After FastQC analysis:

1. **If quality is good**: Proceed to alignment/assembly
2. **If trimming needed**: Use Trimmomatic or fastp
3. **If contamination found**: Filter/remove contaminant sequences
4. **If adapter present**: Perform adapter trimming
