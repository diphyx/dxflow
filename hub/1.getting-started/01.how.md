Learn how dxflow Hub workflows are organized, deployed, and managed across multiple schedulers through the dxflow engine.

## Workflow Structure

Workflows in the Hub are primarily provided as Docker Compose configurations, which dxflow can deploy on various container runtimes and job schedulers. Here's what a typical workflow looks like:

### Basic Workflow Example

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    image: workflow-image:latest
    container_name: dxflow-app

    # Environment variables
    environment:
      - PARAM1=value1
      - PARAM2=value2

    # Data volumes
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./results:/results

    # Port mappings
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

    # Resource limits
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '4'
          memory: 8G
```

### Key Components

**Service Definition**: Each workflow defines one or more services (containers) that work together.

**Environment Configuration**: Variables to customize behavior without changing the workflow file.

**Volume Mounts**: Connect local directories to container paths for data input/output.

**Port Mappings**: Expose container ports to access web interfaces or APIs.

**Resource Limits**: Control CPU, memory, and GPU allocation for each service.

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Browse the Hub

Navigate through workflow categories to find tools for your domain:
- Genomics workflows for DNA/RNA analysis
- Molecular simulations for MD/chemistry
- Structural biology for cryo-EM and structure prediction
- Data science environments for analysis and ML
- Fluid flow simulations for CFD

### Step 2: Select a Workflow

Each workflow page includes:
- **Overview**: What the tool does and key features
- **Docker Compose Configuration**: Complete YAML definition
- **Usage Instructions**: Step-by-step deployment guide
- **Configuration Options**: Available parameters and settings
- **System Requirements**: Resource recommendations

### Step 3: Deploy via dxflow

**Option A: Web Interface**
```
1. Open dxflow web interface (http://localhost)
2. Navigate to "Apps & Pipelines"
3. Click "Hub" or "Templates"
4. Select workflow and click "Deploy"
5. Configure parameters
6. Launch workflow
```

**Option B: Command Line**
```bash
# Deploy workflow from Hub
dxflow compose create --identity my-workflow workflow.yml

# Start the workflow
dxflow compose start my-workflow

# Monitor progress
dxflow compose logs my-workflow
```

### Step 4: Monitor and Manage

Once deployed, you can:
- **View logs** in real-time
- **Check resource usage** (CPU, memory, network)
- **Access web interfaces** if the workflow provides them
- **Stop/restart** workflows as needed
- **Scale services** up or down

## Data Management

### Input Data

Upload your input data before running workflows:

```bash
# Create input directory
dxflow fs create /data/input

# Upload files
dxflow fs upload /local/data.csv /data/input/
```

### Output Data

Download results after workflow completion:

```bash
# List output files
dxflow fs list /data/output

# Download results
dxflow fs download /data/output/ /local/results/
```

### Data Persistence

Workflows use volume mounts to persist data:
- Input data remains accessible across workflow restarts
- Output data is preserved even after stopping workflows
- Shared volumes allow multiple workflows to access the same data

## Workflow Lifecycle

### States

**Created**: Workflow is defined but not running
**Starting**: Containers are being pulled and initialized
**Running**: Workflow is actively executing
**Paused**: Temporarily suspended (can be resumed)
**Stopped**: Cleanly stopped (can be restarted)
**Failed**: Encountered an error (check logs)

### Operations

```bash
# Start workflow
dxflow compose start my-workflow

# Stop workflow
dxflow compose stop my-workflow

# Restart workflow
dxflow compose restart my-workflow

# Pause/unpause (keep state in memory)
dxflow compose pause my-workflow
dxflow compose unpause my-workflow

# Remove workflow completely
dxflow compose remove my-workflow
```

## Common Patterns

### Interactive Workflows

Some workflows provide web interfaces:

```yaml
services:
  jupyter:
    image: jupyter/scipy-notebook
    ports:
      - "8888:8888"  # Access at http://localhost:8888
```

### GPU Workflows

For ML/AI and scientific computing:

```yaml
services:
  ml-training:
    image: tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
```

### Multi-Service Workflows

Complex applications with multiple containers:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"

  api:
    image: api-server
    depends_on:
      - database

  database:
    image: postgres
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

## Best Practices

### Resource Management

**Right-size your resources**:
- Start with recommended minimums
- Monitor actual usage
- Scale up if needed
- Use resource limits to prevent overallocation

### Data Organization

**Keep data organized**:
- Separate input/output directories
- Use meaningful names
- Document data requirements
- Back up important results

### Workflow Monitoring

**Stay informed**:
- Check logs regularly for errors
- Monitor resource usage
- Set up alerts for long-running jobs
- Validate outputs

### Cleanup

**Maintain your environment**:
- Stop unused workflows
- Remove completed workflows
- Clean up old data
- Free up disk space regularly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Workflow won't start**:
- Check if ports are already in use
- Verify sufficient resources available
- Review workflow logs for errors
- Ensure Docker is running

**Out of memory**:
- Increase memory limit in workflow config
- Reduce dataset size for testing
- Check for memory leaks in application

**No output files**:
- Verify volume mount paths
- Check file permissions
- Review workflow logs
- Ensure workflow completed successfully
