Welcome to the dxflow Hub! This section will help you understand how dxflow works and how to make the most of the workflow catalog.

## What is dxflow Hub?

The dxflow Hub is a curated collection of production-ready workflows for scientific computing, data science, and engineering. Workflows are provided primarily as Docker Compose configurations, but can be deployed across multiple container runtimes (Docker, Podman, Singularity) and job schedulers (Kubernetes, Slurm, PBS) through dxflow's unified interface.

## Why Use dxflow Hub?

**Scheduler-Agnostic**: Workflows work with Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, Slurm, and other schedulers through a unified interface.

**Ready-to-Deploy**: All workflows are tested and production-ready with complete configurations.

**Unified Management**: Deploy, monitor, and manage all workflows through a single interface - CLI, API, or web UI.

**Flexible Infrastructure**: Run on any infrastructure - cloud VMs, HPC clusters, edge devices, or your laptop.

**Scientific Focus**: Curated workflows for genomics, molecular dynamics, structural biology, data science, and CFD.
