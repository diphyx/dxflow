# About dxflow

## 1. Our Journey

dxflow began as an internal initiative at DiPhyX to streamline sprawling scripts, clusters, and ad-hoc logs that slow down scientific progress. Initially a weekend hack intended to create a "MLFlow for physics and chemistry," it has evolved through numerous projects in bioinformatics, CFD, and materials science into a robust, production-grade engine available for everyone.

## 2. Our Mission

We are committed to accelerating scientific innovation by offering a unified, scalable, and intuitive cloud platform for end-to-end computational pipelines. Every feature in dxflow is designed to help researchers:
1. Speed up discovery.
2. Ensure reproducibility.
3. Simplify complex computational workflows.

## 3. What We Offer

| Feature                         | Benefit |
|---------------------------------|---------|
| **Run Anywhere**                | Choose local workstations, on-prem HPC, or any major cloud with a simple flag toggle. |
| **Track Everything**            | Automatically capture parameters, code versions, resources, results, and lineage. |
| **Reproducibility**             | Generate immutable run records and environment snapshots to eliminate "it worked on my machine" issues. |
| **Production-Ready Tools**      | Seamlessly move a validated model from prototype to service using the same commands that trained it. |
| **Built-in Post-Processing**    | Launch a Jupyter notebook or connect your favorite BI tool without exporting data. |

## 4. Why dxflow is Different

- **Scientific-First Design:** Engineered to work with a wide range of scientific tools, including GROMACS, Ansys Fluent, SU2, or custom Fortran/C++ solvers.
- **End-to-End Integration:** Manage everything from raw data ingestion to scheduled production pipelines without the need for additional glue scripts.
- **Cost & Carbon Efficiency:** Real-time dashboards display cost per result and COâ‚‚ estimates, empowering labs to optimize both budgets and environmental impact.

## 5. Who We Serve

- **Life-Science Researchers:** Scale up studies on binding affinities with robust computational support.
- **CFD Engineers:** Iterate on aerodynamic design processes more rapidly.
- **Data-Science Teams:** Build physics-informed ML pipelines with ease.
- **Academic Groups & Startups:** Access HPC power without the overhead of managing complex infrastructures.

## 6. Built by Scientists for Scientists

Our core team brings over 20 years of combined experience on national supercomputers and has published more than 50 peer-reviewed papers. We understand the challenges of failed overnight runs and design dxflow to minimize such setbacks.
