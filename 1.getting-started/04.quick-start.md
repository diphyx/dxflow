This guide will walk you through setting up your first dxflow engine and running a simple workflow in under 10 minutes.

::alert{type="info"}
**Prerequisites**: Make sure you have [installed dxflow](/docs/getting-started/installation) before proceeding with this guide.
::

## Step 1: Verify Installation

First, confirm that dxflow is properly installed:

```bash
dxflow --version
```

You should see output similar to:
```
dxflow version v1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Start the Engine

Launch your dxflow engine:

```bash
dxflow boot up
```

::callout{type="success"}
**Success!** You should see a message like:
`Engine successfully booted (use 'CTRL+C' to stop) [~/.dxflow/unix.sock] [0.0.0.0:80]`
::

To learn more about engine management, see the [CLI documentation](/docs/cli/engine/boot).

## Step 3: Access the Web Interface

With the engine running, open your web browser and navigate to:

- **Local access**: `http://localhost`
- **Remote access**: `http://<your-server-ip>`

You should see the dxflow web interface:

## Step 4: Explore the Interface

The dxflow web interface provides several key sections:

::tabs
  ::tab-item{label="Dashboard" icon="i-hugeicons:browser"}
  - System status and resource usage
  - Active workflows overview
  - Recent activity feed
  ::

  ::tab-item{label="Workflows" icon="i-hugeicons:workflow-circle-06"}
  - Create and manage Docker Compose workflows
  - Monitor running containers
  - View logs and events
  ::

  ::tab-item{label="Files" icon="i-hugeicons:folder-library"}
  - Upload and download files
  - Create directories and archives
  - Share files with secure links
  ::

  ::tab-item{label="Terminal" icon="i-hugeicons:computer-terminal-01"}
  - Interactive shell sessions
  - Execute commands remotely
  - Multiple concurrent sessions
  ::
::

## Step 5: Create Your First Workflow

Let's create a simple "Hello World" workflow using Docker Compose:

### 5.1 Using the Web Interface

1. Navigate to the **Workflows** section
2. Click **"Create Workflow"**
3. Name your workflow: `hello-world`
4. Use this simple Docker Compose configuration:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  hello:
    image: hello-world
    container_name: dxflow-hello
```

5. Click **"Create"** to save the workflow

### 5.2 Using the CLI

Alternatively, create the workflow via command line:

```bash
# Create a compose file
echo "version: '3.8'
services:
  hello:
    image: hello-world
    container_name: dxflow-hello" > hello-compose.yml

# Create the workflow
dxflow workflow compose create --identity hello-world hello-compose.yml
```

## Step 6: Run the Workflow

### Start the Workflow

**Web Interface**: Click the **"Start"** button next to your workflow

**CLI**: Use the command line:
```bash
dxflow workflow compose start hello-world
```

### Monitor Progress

**View Logs**:
```bash
dxflow workflow compose logs hello-world
```

**Check Status**:
```bash
dxflow workflow compose list
```

## Step 7: Explore Advanced Features

Now that you have a basic workflow running, explore these features:

::card{title="File Management" icon="i-hugeicons:folder-01"}
```bash
# Upload a file
dxflow object fs upload /path/to/local/file.txt remote-file.txt

# Download a file
dxflow object fs download remote-file.txt /path/to/local/
```
::

::card{title="Shell Access" icon="i-hugeicons:computer-terminal-01"}
```bash
# Create a shell session
dxflow shell create my-session

# Connect to the session
dxflow shell connect my-session
```
::

::card{title="Engine Management" icon="i-hugeicons:settings-01"}
```bash
# Check engine health
dxflow healthcheck

# Test connectivity
dxflow ping

# Generate access tokens
dxflow token
```
::

## Next Steps

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You've successfully set up dxflow and created your first workflow.

### Continue Learning

1. **[Core Concepts](/docs/getting-started/concepts)** - Understand dxflow architecture
2. **[CLI Reference](/docs/cli)** - Master all available commands
3. **[API Documentation](/docs/api)** - Integrate with your applications

## Troubleshooting

**Engine fails to start:**
- Check if port 80 is already in use
- Verify you have proper permissions
- Check system logs for specific errors

**Web interface not accessible:**
- Verify the engine is running: `dxflow ping`
- Check firewall settings allow port 80
- Ensure you're accessing the correct IP address

**Workflow creation fails:**
- Validate your Docker Compose syntax
- Ensure Docker is installed and running
- Check container image availability

Happy computing with dxflow! ðŸš€
