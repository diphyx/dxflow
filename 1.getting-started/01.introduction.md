## What is dxflow?

`dxflow` is a comprehensive distributed computing engine that provides a unified interface for managing and orchestrating data & compute workflows across different computing environments.

::callout{type="info"}
**In short**: dxflow turns any machine you can access into a first-class citizen of your computational fleet, with one installer, a stable URL, and a unified interface for jobs, logs, and data.

  ::card{title="Universal Deployment" icon="i-hugeicons:server"}
  Deploy on any infrastructure: cloud VMs, GPU nodes, on-premise clusters, or even your laptop
  ::

  ::card{title="Unified Interface" icon="i-hugeicons:interface"}
  Consistent CLI, REST API, and web UI across all environments
  ::

  ::card{title="Container Orchestration" icon="i-hugeicons:container"}
  Native Docker Compose integration with real-time monitoring
  ::

  ::card{title="Secure by Design" icon="i-hugeicons:security"}
  RSA key-pair authentication with fine-grained access control

## How It Works

dxflow operates as a lightweight engine that transforms any compute resource into a unified platform:

**Simple 4-Layer Architecture:**
- **Your Infrastructure** - Any compute: cloud, on-premise, or laptop
- **dxflow Engine** - Lightweight daemon providing unified access
- **Native Schedulers** - Works with existing Docker, Kubernetes, Slurm, etc.
- **Your Applications** - Run your actual workloads unchanged

## Core Benefits

  ::tab-item{label="Universal Access" icon="i-hugeicons:globe"}
  **Same interface everywhere** - CLI, web UI, and APIs work identically across all your infrastructure
  ::

  ::tab-item{label="Secure by Default" icon="i-hugeicons:shield"}
  **Enterprise security** - RSA authentication and fine-grained permissions out of the box
  ::

  ::tab-item{label="Native Integration" icon="i-hugeicons:puzzle"}
  **No disruption** - Works with existing Docker, Kubernetes, Slurm, and other schedulers

## Use Cases

dxflow is designed for anyone who needs to manage compute workflows across different environments:

**Common Use Cases:**
- **Data Science**: Multi-GPU ML training and data processing pipelines
- **Research Computing**: HPC simulations and bioinformatics workflows
- **DevOps**: Distributed testing and container orchestration
- **Edge Computing**: IoT processing and edge-to-cloud workflows
