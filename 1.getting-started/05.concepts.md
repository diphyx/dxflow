Understanding these core concepts will help you leverage dxflow's full potential for distributed computing and workflow orchestration.

## Architecture Overview

dxflow follows a layered, modular architecture designed for flexibility and scalability:

::card-group
  ::card{title="Infrastructure Layer" icon="i-hugeicons:cloud-server"}
  Physical or virtual machines, cloud instances, edge devices
  ::

  ::card{title="Engine Layer" icon="i-hugeicons:cpu-charge"}
  The dxflow daemon providing core services and APIs
  ::

  ::card{title="Runtime Layer" icon="i-hugeicons:codesandbox"}
  Docker, Kubernetes, Slurm, or other orchestration platforms
  ::

  ::card{title="Application Layer" icon="i-hugeicons:database"}
  Your actual workloads, models, and data processing pipelines
  ::
::

This layered approach allows dxflow to integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure while providing a consistent interface across diverse environments.

## Core Components

### Engine

The dxflow engine is the heart of each compute node, providing:

::tabs

  ::
::

### Workflows

Workflows are containerized applications managed through industry-standard Docker Compose:

#### Key Features
- **Docker Compose Integration**: Use your existing compose files
- **Lifecycle Management**: Full control over container states
- **Resource Constraints**: CPU, memory, and GPU limits
- **Network Management**: Custom networks and port mappings

- **Multi-container Coordination**: Complex application stacks

### Shell Sessions

Secure, interactive terminal access for debugging and administration:

::callout
Shell sessions provide full terminal capabilities with proper TTY support, making them ideal for interactive debugging and system administration.
::

**Session Features:**
- **Multi-session Support**: Create and manage multiple concurrent shells
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Consistent experience on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Session Persistence**: Long-running sessions survive network disconnections
- **Secure Access**: Authentication-protected with audit logging

**Common Use Cases:**
```bash
# System debugging
dxflow shell create debug-session
dxflow shell connect debug-session

# Interactive development
dxflow shell create dev-environment
# Install dependencies, test code, debug issues
```

### Object Storage (File System)

Integrated file management with enterprise-grade features:

::card-group
  ::card{title="File Operations" icon="i-hugeicons:folder-01"}
  - Upload/download with resume support
  - Directory creation and management
  - Batch operations for efficiency
  - Metadata and permissions
  ::

  ::card{title="Archive Management" icon="i-hugeicons:archive"}
  - Zip/unzip operations
  - Compression algorithms
  - Selective extraction
  - Archive integrity checks
  ::

  ::card{title="Sharing & Collaboration" icon="i-hugeicons:share-08"}
  - Secure sharing links
  - Time-limited access
  - Permission-based sharing
  - Access audit logs
  ::
::

### Proxy Services

Advanced network proxy capabilities for secure service exposure:

#### Proxy Types
- **HTTP/HTTPS Proxy**: Web application and API exposure
- **TCP Proxy**: Database and service connections
- **WebSocket Proxy**: Real-time application support
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple backends

#### Security Features
- **Access Control**: IP allowlists and authentication
- **TLS Termination**: SSL certificate management
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse
- **Audit Logging**: Track all proxy access

### Bridges

Connect and orchestrate multiple dxflow instances for distributed computing:

**Bridge Capabilities:**
- **Multi-node Orchestration**: Coordinate workloads across engines
- **Resource Federation**: Share compute and storage resources
- **Hybrid Cloud Support**: Bridge on-premise and cloud environments
- **Load Distribution**: Optimize resource utilization

## Security Model

### Authentication & Authorization

dxflow implements a comprehensive security model:

#### RSA Key-Pair Authentication
- **Public Key Infrastructure**: Secure, scalable authentication
- **Key Management**: Generate, register, and rotate keys easily
- **Multi-key Support**: Different keys for different access levels

#### Composable Permission System

dxflow implements a flexible permission model where permissions can be combined to create custom access levels:

::card-group
  ::card{title="Base Permissions" icon="i-hugeicons:shield-01"}
  **Functional Permissions** (can be combined):
  - **SHELL**: Terminal session management
  - **OBJECT**: File system operations
  - **WORKFLOW**: Container orchestration
  - **PROXY**: Network proxy services
  - **BRIDGE**: Multi-engine connections
  - **PLATFORM**: Docker platform operations
  ::

  ::card{title="Modifier Permissions" icon="i-hugeicons:shield-01"}
  **READ_ONLY**: Restricts write operations
  - Can be combined with any functional permission
  - Blocks create/modify/delete operations
  - Allows viewing and monitoring only

  **MASTER**: Administrative override
  - Grants full system access
  - Includes all permissions
  - Required for key and user management
  ::
::

#### Permission Examples

::tabs
  ::tab-item{label="Developer Access"}
  ```
  Permissions: SHELL + OBJECT + WORKFLOW

  Can:
  - Create and connect to shell sessions
  - Upload/download files and manage directories
  - Create, start, stop workflows
  - Execute commands in containers

  Cannot:
  - Manage proxy services or bridges
  - Access Docker platform operations
  - Perform administrative tasks
  ```
  ::

  ::tab-item{label="Read-Only Monitoring"}
  ```
  Permissions: WORKFLOW + SHELL + READ_ONLY

  Can:
  - View workflow status and logs
  - List shell sessions
  - Monitor system health
  - Access read-only endpoints

  Cannot:

  - Full file system access
  - Connect to remote engines

  - Access shell sessions
  - Manage proxy services
  ```
  ::

  ::tab-item{label="System Administrator"}
  ```
  Permissions: MASTER

  Can:
  - All system operations
  - User and key management
  - Engine configuration
  - Complete administrative control

  Note: MASTER includes all other permissions
  ```
  ::
::

::callout
**Default Configuration**: New users receive `PROXY + BRIDGE + SHELL + OBJECT + PLATFORM + WORKFLOW` permissions, providing comprehensive functionality without administrative privileges or read-only restrictions.
::

### Network Security

- **TLS Encryption**: All communications secured with industry-standard encryption
- **Certificate Management**: Automatic certificate generation and renewal
- **Network Isolation**: Unix domain sockets for local communication
- **Firewall Integration**: Works with existing network security policies

## Best Practices

### Engine Deployment
- **Resource Planning**: Size engines based on expected workloads
- **High Availability**: Deploy multiple engines for redundancy
- **Monitoring**: Set up health checks and alerting
- **Backup**: Regular configuration and data backups

### Workflow Design
- **Resource Limits**: Always specify CPU and memory constraints
- **Health Checks**: Implement container health checks
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handle SIGTERM signals properly
- **Logging**: Use structured logging for better debugging

### Security Hardening
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate authentication keys
- **Audit Logging**: Monitor all access and operations
- **Network Segmentation**: Use firewalls and VPNs appropriately

## Advanced Topics

### Integration Patterns
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automate deployments with dxflow APIs
- **Monitoring Integration**: Connect with Prometheus, Grafana, etc.
- **Service Mesh**: Deploy alongside Istio or Linkerd
- **GitOps**: Manage configurations with Git workflows

### Scaling Strategies
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more engine nodes as needed
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increase resources on existing nodes
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on workload demand
- **Edge Deployment**: Distribute engines to edge locations

This comprehensive understanding of dxflow concepts will enable you to design and implement robust, scalable distributed computing solutions.
