dxflow uses a permission-based licensing system to control access to various features and capabilities. Licenses are cryptographically signed to ensure authenticity.

::callout{color="blue"}
**Quick Start**: dxflow comes with a built-in General License that provides full access to core features until 2030. You can use dxflow immediately without creating a custom license!
::

## Default License (General)

dxflow includes a General License that provides:

- **Valid until**: January 1, 2030
- **Full access** to all core features
- **No registration** required
- **Perfect for** evaluation, development, and general use

## License Permissions

Licenses control access to the following modules:

::card-group
  ::card{title="Core Modules" icon="i-hugeicons:database-01"}
  - **shell** - Terminal access and command execution
  - **object** - File storage and management
  - **platform** - Docker and platform integrations
  - **workflow** - Compose workflow orchestration
  ::

  ::card{title="Network Modules" icon="i-hugeicons:neural-network"}
  - **bridge** - Network bridge connections (with traffic limits)
  - **proxy** - Proxy configurations and tunnels (with traffic limits)
  ::
::

## Getting Your Identity

Before creating a license, you need your machine's unique identity:

```bash
dxflow engine info
```

Output example:
```
Identity:    cc2bcf4a9fc3fa056189533df3ee3af6
Directory:   /home/user/.dxflow
Profile:     default
```

::callout{color="amber"}
**Important**: The Identity value is unique to your machine. Licenses are tied to this identity and cannot be transferred between machines.
::

## License Commands

### View Current License

Check your active license details:

```bash
dxflow license info
```

### Create a New License

The easiest way to create a license:

```bash
dxflow license create
```

This command:
1. Opens your browser to the license portal
2. Pre-fills your Identity and name
3. Guides you through authentication
4. Generates your license file

### Activate a License

After downloading your license:

```bash
dxflow license activate your-license.json
```

## Creating a Custom License

::steps
  ### Step 1: Run the Create Command

  ```bash
  dxflow license create
  ```

  Your browser will open with your details pre-filled.

  ### Step 2: Authenticate

  Choose your authentication method:

  ::tabs
    ::tab-item{label="Google" icon="i-fa7-brands:google"}
    - Sign in with your Google account
    - Verification through email address
    - Quick and seamless process
    ::

    ::tab-item{label="Stripe" icon="i-fa7-brands:stripe-s"}
    - Perfect if you don't have a Google account
    - Verify using any payment card
    - **No charges** - card is for verification only
    - We don't store or charge your card
    ::

  ### Step 3: Configure Your License

  Provide a name for your license. All other settings are automatically configured:
  - **Validity**: 5 years (2025-2030)
  - **Permissions**: All core modules enabled
  - **Bridge**: 1 connection, 10MB traffic
  - **Proxy**: Disabled by default

  ### Step 4: Download and Activate

  Download the generated license file and activate it:

  ```bash
  dxflow license activate your-license.json
  ```
::

## License Format

dxflow licenses are JSON files with the following structure:

```json
{
  "identity": "your-machine-identity",
  "name": "License Name",
  "owner": "Anonymous",
  "starts": "Mon, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT",
  "expires": "Mon, 01 Jan 2030 00:00:00 GMT",
  "permission": {
    "shell": {},
    "object": {},
    "platform": {},
    "workflow": {},
    "bridge": {
      "count": 1,
      "traffic": 10240000
    }
  },
  "signature": "cryptographic-signature",
  "issued": "Mon, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT"
}
```

## Using dxflow Without a License

::callout
**No License Needed!** dxflow automatically uses the built-in General License if you don't create a custom one. This provides full access to all core features until 2030.
::

The General License is perfect for:
- Trying out dxflow
- Development and testing
- Personal projects
- Small-scale deployments

You only need a custom license if you want to:
- Track usage with a personalized identity
- Prepare for post-2030 usage
- Meet organizational compliance requirements

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens if I don't have a license?

dxflow uses the built-in General license by default, providing full access to core features until 2030.

### How are licenses verified?

Licenses use RSA cryptographic signatures to ensure they haven't been tampered with. Verification happens automatically on activation.

### How do I get a license?

Simply run `dxflow license create`. Your browser will open with your Identity pre-filled. After authenticating with Google or Stripe, you can download and activate your license.

### I don't have a Google account. Can I still create a license?

Yes! Choose the Stripe authentication option. It works with any payment card and is just as easy. Your card is only used for identity verification - no charges will be made.

### Why is authentication required?

Authentication prevents abuse and ensures each license is tied to a verified identity. Both Google and Stripe are used solely for identity verification - no payment or personal data is collected beyond what's needed for verification.

### What if my license expires?

When your license expires, simply run:

```bash
dxflow license create
```

This will open your browser with your details pre-filled. After authenticating and creating a new license, activate it with:

```bash
dxflow license activate new-license.json
```

## Troubleshooting

::tabs
  ::tab-item{label="Common Issues"}

  **License not verified**
  - Check that the license file hasn't been modified
  - Ensure the license identity matches your machine's identity
  - Verify system date/time is correct

  **License expired**
  - Check expiration date with `dxflow license info`
  - Create a new license using `dxflow license create`

  **Invalid license signature**
