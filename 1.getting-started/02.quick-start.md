This guide will walk you through setting up your first dxflow engine and running a simple workflow in under 10 minutes.

::callout
**Prerequisites**: Make sure you have [installed dxflow](/docs/getting-started/installation) before proceeding with this guide.
::

## Step 1: Verify Installation

First, confirm that dxflow is properly installed:

```bash
dxflow --version
```

You should see output similar to:
```
dxflow version v1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Start the Engine

Launch your dxflow engine with different modes:

### Basic Start (Foreground Mode)
```bash
dxflow boot up
```

::callout{color="green"}
**Success!** You should see a message like:
`Engine successfully booted (use 'CTRL+C' to stop) [~/.dxflow/unix.sock] [0.0.0.0:80]`
::

### Advanced Boot Options

**Run as daemon (Linux only):**
```bash
dxflow boot up --daemon
```

**Enable HTTPS:**
```bash
dxflow boot up --https
```

**Hub mode with subdomain allocation:**
```bash
dxflow boot up --proxy
```

**Bridge mode (connect to hub):**
```bash
dxflow boot up --bridge
```

::callout{color="amber"}
**Note**: `--proxy` and `--bridge` are mutually exclusive. Use `--proxy` to make this instance a hub, or `--bridge` to connect to an existing hub.
::

To learn more about boot modes and flags, see the [Advanced Boot Configuration](/docs/advanced/boot) for comprehensive details about all boot options, network architectures, and deployment patterns.

## Step 3: Access the Web Interface

With the engine running, open your web browser and navigate to:

- **Local access**: `http://localhost`
- **Remote access**: `http://<your-server-ip>`

You should see the dxflow web interface:

## Step 4: Explore the Interface

The dxflow web interface provides four main sections for managing your workflows, files, and system resources.

::callout
**Detailed Interface Guide**: For comprehensive information about each interface section, see the [User Interface documentation](/docs/interface).
::

## Step 5: Create Your First Workflow

Let's create a simple "Hello World" workflow using Docker Compose:

### 5.1 Using the Web Interface

1. Navigate to the **Workflows** section
2. Click **"Create Workflow"**
3. Name your workflow: `hello-world`
4. Use this simple Docker Compose configuration:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  hello:
    image: hello-world
    container_name: dxflow-hello
```

5. Click **"Create"** to save the workflow

### 5.2 Using the CLI

Alternatively, create the workflow via command line:

First, create a Docker Compose file:

```yaml
# hello-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  hello:
    image: hello-world
    container_name: dxflow-hello
```

Then create the workflow using the CLI:

```bash
# Create the workflow
dxflow workflow compose create --identity hello-world hello-compose.yml
```

## Step 6: Run the Workflow

### Start the Workflow

**Web Interface**: Click the **"Start"** button next to your workflow

**CLI**: Use the command line:
```bash
dxflow workflow compose start hello-world
```

### Monitor Progress

**View Logs**:
```bash
dxflow workflow compose logs hello-world
```

**Check Status**:
```bash
dxflow workflow compose list
```

## Step 7: Explore Advanced Features

Now that you have a basic workflow running, explore additional capabilities:

::callout{color="blue"}
**Quick Examples**: Here are some essential commands to get you started. For comprehensive guides, see the [Interface documentation](/docs/interface) and [CLI reference](/docs/cli).

### File Management
```bash
# Upload files
dxflow fs upload <local-path> <remote-path>

# Download files
dxflow fs download <remote-path> <local-path>

# Create ZIP archives
dxflow fs zip <source-path> <archive-name>

# Share files
dxflow fs share <file-path>
```

### Shell Operations
```bash
# Create a shell session
dxflow shell create <session-name>

# Connect to shell
dxflow shell connect <session-name>

# List shells
dxflow shell list
```

### Engine Management
```bash
# Check health
dxflow healthcheck

# View statistics
dxflow stat

# Update engine
dxflow engine update

# Generate auth token
dxflow engine token
```

### Bridge & Proxy Features
```bash
# List bridges
dxflow bridge list

# Create proxy subdomain
dxflow proxy list
```

### Key Management
```bash
# Generate RSA key pair
dxflow key generate

# Register key
dxflow key register <public-key>

# List registered keys
dxflow key list
```

## Next Steps

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You've successfully set up dxflow and created your first workflow.

### Continue Learning

1. **[CLI Reference](/docs/cli)** - Master all available commands
2. **[API Documentation](/docs/api)** - Integrate with your applications
3. **[Advanced Topics](/docs/advanced)** - Explore performance optimization and enterprise patterns

## Troubleshooting

**Engine fails to start:**
- Check if port 80 is already in use
- Verify you have proper permissions
- Check system logs for specific errors

**Web interface not accessible:**
- Verify the engine is running: `dxflow ping`
- Check firewall settings allow port 80
- Ensure you're accessing the correct IP address

**Workflow creation fails:**
- Validate your Docker Compose syntax
- Ensure Docker is installed and running
- Check container image availability

Happy computing with dxflow! ðŸš€
