# Getting Started with dxflow

Welcome to dxflow - a powerful and flexible workflow engine that allows you to build and execute complex workflows with ease. Whether you're running data science pipelines, orchestrating container workflows, or managing high-performance computing jobs, dxflow provides a unified interface across all your environments.

## What is dxflow?

`dxflow` is a powerful workflow engine that provides a unified interface for managing and orchestrating data & compute workflows across different computing environments. Built with a modular architecture, dxflow seamlessly integrates Docker Compose workflows, shell operations, object storage, network bridging, and proxy management.

::callout{color="green"}
**In short**: dxflow turns any machine you can access into a first-class citizen of your computational fleet, with one installer, a stable URL, and a unified interface for jobs, logs, and data.

### Key Features

::card-group
  ::card{title="Universal Deployment"}
  Deploy on any infrastructure: Linux, macOS, Windows - cloud VMs, GPU nodes, on-premise clusters, or your laptop
  ::

  ::card{title="Unified Interface"}
  Consistent CLI, REST API, and modern Nuxt.js web UI across all environments
  ::

  ::card{title="Advanced Orchestration"}
  Native Docker Compose workflows, shell management, WebSocket tunneling, and proxy capabilities
  ::

  ::card{title="Secure & Flexible"}
  JWT authentication, RSA key-pairs, flexible licensing, and self-update capabilities
  ::

**Simple 4-Layer Architecture:**
- **Your Infrastructure** - Any compute: cloud, on-premise, or laptop
- **dxflow Engine** - Lightweight daemon providing unified access
- **Native Schedulers** - Works with existing Docker, Kubernetes, Slurm, etc.
- **Your Applications** - Run your actual workloads unchanged

## Core Benefits
