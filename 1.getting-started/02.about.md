# About dxflow

## 1. Our Journey

dxflow began as an internal initiative at [DiPhyX](https://www.diphyx.com) to streamline sprawling scripts, clusters, and ad-hoc logs that slow down scientific progress. Initially a weekend hack intended to create a "MLFlow for physics and chemistry," it has evolved through numerous projects in bioinformatics, CFD, and materials science into a robust, production-grade engine available for everyone.

## 2. Our Mission

We are committed to accelerating scientific innovation by offering a unified, scalable, and intuitive cloud platform for end-to-end computational pipelines. Every feature in dxflow is designed to help researchers:
1. Speed up discovery.
2. Ensure reproducibility.
3. Simplify complex computational workflows.

## 3. Our Solution

dxflow provides a unified distributed computing platform that addresses the fragmentation and complexity of modern computational environments:

::card-group
  ::card{title="Universal Deployment"}
  Deploy anywhere: local workstations, cloud instances, HPC clusters, or edge devices
  ::

  ::card{title="Consistent Interface"}
  Same CLI, web UI, and APIs across all your infrastructure and schedulers
  ::

  ::card{title="Enterprise Security"}
  RSA authentication, fine-grained permissions, and TLS encryption built-in
  ::
::

## 4. Scientific-First Approach

**Built for Real Research Needs:**
- **Native Compatibility**: Works with GROMACS, Ansys Fluent, custom solvers, and any containerized application
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Runs on existing infrastructure without requiring cloud migration
- **Researcher-Friendly**: Designed by scientists who understand the pain of failed overnight runs

## 5. Who Benefits
