This guide will help you quickly set up and run a simple dxflow project.

The first step is to install the dxflow engine. You can do this by downloading and installing the latest release by following the [installation guide](/getting-started/installation).

Now that you have the dxflow engine installed, you can start using it. Let's check if the installation was successful by running the following command:

```/dev/null/terminal.sh#L1-1
dxflow --version
```

Now let's start the dxflwo engine. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
dxflow engine up
```
To learn more about the `dxflow engine` command see the [engine management documentation](/docs/cli/engine).

This will print out this message:

```bash
Engine successfully booted (use 'CTRL+C' to stop) [~/.dxflow/unix.sock] [0.0.0.0:80]
```
This command will start the dxflow engine and make it available for use. go to your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost` or `http://<your-server-ip>` if you are running it on a remote server. You should see the dxflow user interface.
Now you can start building your dxflow workflows!
