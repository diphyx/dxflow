description: Complete command-line interface reference for the dxflow engine with detailed usage examples and options
---

dxflow provides a comprehensive command-line interface that adapts to your environment, supporting local execution, remote server management, and automatic instant engine spawning for seamless operations.

::callout{color="blue"}
**Two Execution Types**: Commands run either locally on your machine or remotely on configured servers. Some commands also support automatic instant engine spawning for zero-setup operations.
::

## Command Execution Types

::card-group
  ::card{title="Local Commands" icon="i-heroicons:computer-desktop"}
  **Always Local**
  - Configuration management
  - Engine lifecycle control
  - License operations
  - System information
  ::

  ::card{title="Remote Commands" icon="i-heroicons:cloud"}
  **Server Infrastructure**
  - Engine monitoring
  - Bridge management
  - Shell operations
  - Proxy control
  ::
::

## Local Commands

Commands that always execute on your local machine for configuration and system management.

::callout{color="green"}
**Local Execution**: These commands run locally regardless of any remote configuration, managing your local dxflow installation and settings.
::

### Available Commands

::tabs
  ::tab-item{label="Configuration"}

  - `config get` - Get configuration value
  - `config set` - Set configuration value
  - `config unset` - Remove configuration value

  ::

  ::tab-item{label="Engine Control"}

  - `engine info` - Display local engine information
  - `engine token` - Generate authentication token
  - `engine key generate` - Generate RSA key pair for authentication
  - `boot up` - Start the engine with configured servers
  - `boot down` - Gracefully shut down the running engine instance

  ::

  ::tab-item{label="Licensing"}

  - `license activate` - Activate license
  - `license create` - Create license
  - `license info` - Display license information

  ::
::

### Common Operations

```bash
# Configuration management
dxflow config set connection-address "https://server.com"
dxflow config get connection-address

# Engine lifecycle
dxflow boot up --daemon
dxflow boot down

# License management
dxflow license info
```

## Remote Commands

Commands that execute on configured remote dxflow servers for distributed infrastructure management.

  - `object fs create` - Create files or directories
  - `object fs delete` - Delete files or directories
  - `object fs rename` - Rename/move files or directories
  - `object fs upload` - Upload files to remote storage
  - `object fs download` - Download files from remote storage

  - `workflow compose list` - List all workflow compositions
  - `workflow compose create` - Create a new workflow composition
  - `workflow compose remove` - Remove a workflow composition
  - `workflow compose start` - Start all services defined in the workflow
  - `workflow compose stop` - Gracefully stop all running containers
  - `workflow compose kill` - Immediately terminate workflow containers
  - `workflow compose pause` - Suspend all processes in workflow containers
  - `workflow compose unpause` - Resume execution of paused containers
  - `workflow compose containers` - List containers in the workflow

  ::
::

### Remote Setup

```bash
# Configure connection
dxflow config set connection-address "https://prod.server.com"
dxflow config set connection-key "/secure/prod-key.pem"

# Test connection
dxflow engine ping

# Manage remote resources
dxflow shell create production
dxflow bridge list
```

::callout{color="blue"}
**Advanced Configuration**: See [Remoting](/docs/advanced/remoting) for detailed remote setup, authentication, profiles, and multi-environment management.
::

## Instant Engine Support

Some commands support automatic instant engine spawning for local execution when no persistent engine is running.

::callout
**Smart Execution**: These commands adapt to your environment - remote when configured, local engine when available, or automatic instant engine spawning for local execution only.
::

### How It Works

Instant engine commands follow this execution priority:

1. **Remote Configured?** → Execute on remote server (using server's engine)
2. **Local Engine Running?** → Use local persistent engine
3. **Otherwise** → Spawn temporary instant engine locally

::callout{color="amber"}
**Important**: Instant engines only work for local execution. Remote commands always use the server's running engine, never instant engines.
::
